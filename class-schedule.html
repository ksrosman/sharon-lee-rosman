<h3>Personal Growth Book Club</h3>
<p>Fridays, monthly at Levy Senior Center</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Discuss non-fiction books geared toward improving the quality of our lives. Book topics will include gratitude, happiness, mindfulness, relationships, positivity, managing stress and loneliness, finding meaning and purpose, and many more.

<h3>Death Cafe</h3>
<p>Fridays, monthly at the Levy Senior Center</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Death Cafe brings the topic of death out of the closet the first Friday morning of the month. This is a unique opportunity to come together and talk about death: our fears, our beliefs, everything that’s on our minds regarding this traditionally-taboo subject. This is solely a discussion group and not a bereavement/
grief counseling group.</p>
