<h3>Personal Growth Book Club</h3>

Book topics will include gratitude, happiness, mindfulness, relationships, positivity, managing stress and loneliness, finding meaning and purpose, and many more.

<h3>Death Cafe</h3>
<p>Fridays, monthly at the Levy Senior Center</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Death Cafe brings the topic of death out of the closet the first Friday morning of the month. This is a unique opportunity to come together and talk about death: our fears, our beliefs, everything that’s on our minds regarding this traditionally-taboo subject. This is solely a discussion group and not a bereavement/
grief counseling group.</p>

<h3>Gratitude Club</h3>
<p>Tuesdays, monthly at Oakton Center</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>This once-a-month discussion group is for people who are interested in shifting their awareness from
everything that’s wrong, negative or missing in their life, to a heightened appreciation for everything that is going “right.” Join the club and find out how learning to be grateful can improve the quality, maybe even the quantity, of your life. Please pre-register for this
discussion group. </p>

<h3>Mindfulness and Meditation</h3>
<p>Tuesday, monthly at Oakton Center</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Change your life through meditation and mindfulness! Reduce your regrets about the past and worries about the future, and learn to live in the present. You will reduce stress, anxiety and depression, as well as decrease blood pressure and improve immune system functioning, sleep, and your energy level. Additional benefits include improved relationships, better concentration, improved happiness, and more peace in your daily life. (Please register in advance for this class.)</p>

<h3>Wellness Workshop</h3>
<p>Tuesday, monthly at Oakton Center</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Join us the third Tuesday of each month for a new topic such as nutrition education, safe and effective forms of exercise, grocery shopping, restaurant skills, meditation, the pros and cons of supplements, making the most out of doctor visits, increasing your daily activity, and much more.</p>
